## can be formatted as a string, or a regex pattern :
##
#### `objectives: "global"`
###### shares only the scoreboard named `global`
##
#### objectives: "^global.*"
###### shares any scoreboard starting with `global`.  Ex: global_islandfall_wins
#### objectives: ^(global.*|coins)$
###### shares any scoreboard starting with `global`, as well as the exact scoreboard `coins`
objectives: "^global.*"
