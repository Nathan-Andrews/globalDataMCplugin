## the scoreboards which are shared between servers
## should be formatted as a regex pattern :
##
#### `objectives: "^global"`
###### shares only the scoreboard named `global`
##
#### objectives: "^global.*"
###### shares any scoreboard starting with `global`.  Ex: global_islandfall_wins
#### objectives: "^(global.*|coins)$""
###### shares any scoreboard starting with `global`, as well as the exact scoreboard `coins`
objectives: "^global.*"

## path to the shared storage directory
##
#### directory_path: "C:\\Users\\BlackTemplar\\Desktop\\Minermen network"
###### creates the directory C:\Users\BlackTemplar\Desktop\Minermen network\GlobalData
directory_path: ""

## name of the storage file
##
#### storage_filename: "database.db"
###### File stored in directory_path\GlobalData\database.db to be accessed by servers on the network
storage_filename: "database.db"
